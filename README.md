## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm a junior developer, each challenge helps me to improve, this one helped me to improve mainly in CSS, writing the formatting of containers, checking if it's better to use margin or padding, alignments with Flexbox to achieve the desired result.

### Continued development

I look forward to completing new challenges and improving my skills, "a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor"
